# Editing these files on their own will not change the game behavior.
# You must run build_default_list.py to generate a new default_name_list.lua
# The name list is only generated the first time a mod is loaded unless a special command is used to force reloading the master_list from default_name_list.lua (which doesn't exist yet)

# Conversely, when I get around to allowing editing the lists in game, these files serve as good examples for how lists are formatted!
