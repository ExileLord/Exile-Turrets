# Exile Turrets

This is a small mod for Factorio that tracks the stats of turrets and humanizes them a little. The mod will autogenerate names for turrets based on their type. Turrets are ranked based on kills but can also be sorted by damage dealt, damage taken, and other statistics. Players can award medals to turrets for doing a particularly outstanding job or for any other reason they want. You're the commander.
